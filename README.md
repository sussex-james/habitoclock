# How to run this
Get a copy of the `secrets.js` file for /config.
Then run `npm start` (it will render without secrets.js, but will break at the Form point)


# Goal


# Judging Criteria:
The most insightful is what we are to. A lot of people don't know
that when they drink coffee can mean as much as 25% more usage of Carbon!

We want to make it easy for anybody to establish their carbon usage.

What makes it insightful is that because we use large language models to estimate usage generically,
we can estimate usage for most kinds of habit, not just have a preopulated list.

That gives users a lot more freedom than other tools!
